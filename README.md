## Project Overview

The **Real-Time Cryptocurrency Price Tracker** is a Python script that allows users to retrieve real-time cryptocurrency prices, percentage price changes, and historical price data using the CoinGecko public API. The script also offers a simple visualization of historical price trends. Refer to [CoinGecko API](https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/introduction) and [CoinGecko Coins List](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list) for more information.
